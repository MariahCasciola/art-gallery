### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

## My process

- Used React to break up the process into a more digestible format for a single page

- Place assets folder in src folder so they can be accessed in components via file paths

- Create a skeleton with all of the required text and image links

- Split the web page design into three and place in different components

/* MAKE CONCISE CLASSES FOR EACH CONTAINER */
/* START AT THE TOP, WORK YOUR WAY TO THE BOTTOM */
/* REFINE EACH COMPONENT ONE AT A TIME */
/* CHECK RESPON ON PIXEL 7, ULTRA 20, AND GALAXY S9+ AND S8*/

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Google Font API
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Learned about SVGs as an alternative to JPEGS, gifs and PNGs(that they are used with vectors instead of pixel grids) and scale up and down with resolution without losing quality.

- Learned how to use @font-face property in CSS for .ttf files


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
