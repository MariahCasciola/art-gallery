### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

- Used React to break up the process into a more digestible format, header, main, and footer.

- Placed assets folder in src folder so they can be accessed in components via file paths

- Create a skeleton with all of the required text and image links.

- Styled mobile view, tablet view, and desktop view in that order.

- Identified flex box and flex directions in mobile before tackling flex box before designing tablet and desktop boxes and directions.

- Created reusable well named classes in order to create a more clean and dry stylesheet.

- When styling I started at the top of the page and worked my way down the document, checking responsiveness with every new class and property.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Google Font API
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Learned about SVGs as an alternative to JPEGS, gifs and PNGs(that they are used with vectors instead of pixel grids) and scale up and down with resolution without losing quality.

- Learned how to use @font-face property in CSS for .ttf files

- Learned about the clip-path property

- Learned about the z-index property

### Continued development
